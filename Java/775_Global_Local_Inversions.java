We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.

The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].

The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].

Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.

All local inversions are global inversions.
If the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions,
it means that all global inversions in permutations are local inversions.
It also means that we can not find A[i] > A[j] with i+2<=j.
In other words, max(A[i]) < A[i+2]

class Solution {
    public boolean isIdealPermutation(int[] A) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length - 2; i++){
            max = Math.max(max, A[i]);
            if (max > A[i+2]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
